I'm currently researching adaptive radar technologies and optimised resource allocation as a doctoral student at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) in cooperation with the [Netherlands Organisation for applied scientific research](https://www.tno.nl/en/).

In my spare time I work on guitar effect pedals and far too elaborate spreadsheets.
